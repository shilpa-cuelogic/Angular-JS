Hello, and welcome to our Terms and Conditions of Use. This is important and affects your legal rights, so please read them and our <a href="&lt;?php echo site_url('privacy-policy'); ?&gt;" target="_blank">Privacy Policy</a> carefully. We hope you're sitting comfortably. Here we goâ€¦
<h3><a name="introduction"></a>1. Introduction</h3>
Thanks for choosing HealthCheque ("HealthCheque", "we", "us", "our"). By using the HealthCheque service, websites, or software applications (together, the "HealthCheque Service" or "Service"), including by purchasing or receiving Codes or Limited Offers, you are entering into a binding contract with our local company in your country of residence (your "Local Country") if applicable or the company listed in this chart. Your agreement with us includes these Terms and Conditions of Use ("Terms") and our Privacy Policy (the "Agreements"). If you don't agree with these Terms, then please don't use the Service.
We're pleased to make our Service available to you. The HealthCheque Service includes social and interactive features. Learn more about the HealthCheque Service here.
In order to use the HealthCheque Service, you need to (a) be 18 or older, or be 13 or older and have your parent or guardian's consent to these Terms, (b) have the power to enter a binding contract with us and are not barred from doing so under any applicable laws, and (c) be resident in the Local Country. You also warrant that any registration information that you submit to HealthCheque is true, accurate and complete, and you agree to keep it that way at all times.
<h3><a name="changes"></a> 2. Changes to the Agreements</h3>
<h4><strong>2.1 Registration data</strong></h4>
Occasionally we may, in our discretion, make changes to the HealthCheque Service and Agreements. When we make changes to the Agreements that we consider material, we'll notify you through the Service. By continuing to use the Service after those changes are made, you are expressing and acknowledging your acceptance of the changes.
<h3><a name="use-information"></a> 3. Enjoying HealthCheque</h3>
Here's some information about all the ways you can enjoy HealthCheque.
<h4><a name="use-information-1"></a>3.1 Subscriptions</h4>
HealthCheque account holders may access the HealthCheque Service by any of our several Subscriptions:
<ul class="disc">
	<li>Free Service: an ad-based, free-of-charge service;</li>
	<li>Subscription Service: a subscription fee-based service;</li>
	<li>Mobile Service: via a supported mobile handset.</li>
</ul>
The Subscription Service is hereinafter referred to as "Paid Subscriptions"
<h4><a name="use-information-2"></a>3.2 Codes and other Limited Offers</h4>
If you have purchased a code sold by or on behalf of HealthCheque for access to the Service for the time period indicated on your email, card or paper receipt ("Code"), or if you are accessing the service through some other limited offer which you received or purchased from HealthCheque ("Limited Offer"), these Agreements apply to your access to the Service. Any separate sets of terms and conditions presented to you along with the Code or other Limited Offer also apply to your access to the Service using the Code or Limited Offer.
Subject to any rights you may have under Section 12, Codes are only redeemable in the country where you purchased such Code, not redeemable for cash and may not be returned for a cash refund, exchanged, resold or used to purchase other Codes.
<h4><a name="use-information-3"></a>3.3 Trials</h4>
From time to time, we may offer trials of the Service for a specified period without payment (a "Trial"). HealthCheque reserves the right, in its absolute discretion, to determine your eligibility for a Trial, and to withdraw or to modify a Trial at any time without prior notice and with no liability.
For some Trials, we'll require you to provide your payment details to start the Trial. At the end of such Trials, we may automatically start to charge you for the Service on the first day following the end of the Trial, on a recurring monthly basis. By providing your payment details in conjunction with the Trial, you agree to this charge. If you do not want this charge, you must change your Subscription to the Free Service through your HealthCheque account's settings or by contacting HealthCheque before the end of the Trial.
<h3><a name="licence"></a>4. Licence and assignment</h3>
The HealthCheque Service and the content provided through it are the property of HealthCheque or HealthCheque's licensors, and we grant you a limited, non-exclusive, revocable licence to make personal, non-commercial (except as permitted under Section 11) use of the HealthCheque Service and to receive the content made available through the HealthCheque Service in your Local Country, based on the Subscription or Trial, you have selected (the "Licence"). This Licence shall remain in effect for a period of 20 years unless terminated by you or HealthCheque.

HealthCheque does not monitor, review, or edit User Content, but reserves the right to remove or disable access to any User Content for any or no reason, including but not limited to, User Content that, in HealthCheque's sole discretion, violates these Agreements.

You grant HealthCheque a non-exclusive, transferable, sub-licensable, royalty-free, perpetual, worldwide license to use, reproduce, make available to the public, publish, translate and distribute any User Content that you post on or otherwise provide through the HealthCheque Service.
These Terms are not intended to grant rights to anyone except you and HealthCheque, and in no event shall these Terms create any third party beneficiary rights. Any failure by HealthCheque to enforce these Terms or any provision thereof shall not waive HealthCheque's right to do so.

</ul>
<h3><a name="export"></a>12. Export control</h3>
HealthCheque's products may be subject to U.S. export and reexport control laws and regulations, including the Export Administration Regulations ("EAR") maintained by the U.S. Department of Commerce, trade and economic sanctions maintained by the Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Assets Control ("OFAC"), and the International Traffic in Arms Regulations ("ITAR") maintained by the Department of State. You warrant that you are (1) not located in Cuba, Iran, North Korea, Sudan, or Syria, and (2) are not a denied party as specified in the regulations listed above.
You agree to comply with all applicable export and reexport control laws and regulations, including the EAR, trade and economic sanctions maintained by OFAC, and the ITAR. Specifically, you agree that you shall not â€“ directly or indirectly â€“ sell, export, reexport, transfer, divert, or otherwise dispose of any products, software, or technology (including products derived from or based on such technology) received from HealthCheque under these Agreements to any destination, entity, or person prohibited by the laws or regulations of the United States, without obtaining prior authorization from the competent government authorities as required by those laws and regulations. This export control clause shall survive termination or cancellation of these Agreements.
<h3><a name="payments"></a>13. Payments, cancellations and cooling off</h3>
If you reside in a Local Country which is part of the European Union and have purchased a Paid Subscription or Code online, you have the right to change your mind and receive a full refund within fourteen (14) days of purchase (the "Cooling-off Period"), but only if you have not logged in or otherwise redeemed or started to consume them.
If you have a Paid Subscription, your payment to HealthCheque will automatically renew at the end of the subscription period, unless you cancel your Paid Subscription by contacting HealthCheque before the end of the current subscription period. The cancellation will take effect the day after the last day of the current subscription period. However, if you cancel your payment and/or terminate the Terms after the Cooling-off Period is over (where applicable), and/or before the end of the subscription period, we will not refund any subscription fees already paid to us.
HealthCheque may change the price for the Paid Subscriptions from time to time, and will communicate any price changes to you. Price changes for Paid Subscriptions will take effect at the start of the next subscription period following the date of the price change. By continuing to use the HealthCheque Service after the price change takes effect, you accept the new price.
<h3><a name="terms-termination"></a>14. Term and termination</h3>
These Terms will continue to apply to you until terminated by either you or HealthCheque. HealthCheque may terminate the Terms or suspend your access to the HealthCheque Service at any time, including in the event of your actual or suspected unauthorised use of the HealthCheque Service or non-compliance with the Terms. If you or HealthCheque terminate the Terms, or if HealthCheque suspends your access to the HealthCheque Service, you agree that HealthCheque shall have no liability or responsibility to you and HealthCheque will not refund any amounts that you have already paid, to the fullest extent permitted under applicable law. To learn how to terminate your HealthCheque account, please contact HealthCheque at <a href="mailto: account@healthcheque.me">account@healthcheque.me</a>.
<h3><a name="warranty"></a>15. Warranty</h3>
We endeavor to provide the best service we can, but you understand and agree that <span class="warranty_text">THE HEALTHCHEQUE SERVICE IS PROVIDED "AS IS", WITHOUT EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTY OR CONDITION OF ANY KIND. YOU USE THE HEALTHCHEQUE SERVICE AT YOUR OWN RISK. HEALTHCHEQUE DISCLAIMS ANY WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGEMENT.</span> In addition, HealthCheque does not warrant, endorse, guarantee or assume responsibility for any Third Party Applications, Third Party Application content, User Content, or any other product or service advertised or offered by a third party on or through the HealthCheque Service or any hyperlinked website, or featured in any banner or other advertising. You understand and agree that HealthCheque is not responsible or liable for any transaction between you and third parties or any provider of Third Party Applications or products or services advertised on or through the HealthCheque Service. As with any purchase of a product or service through any medium or in any environment, you should use your judgment and exercise caution where appropriate. No advice or information whether oral or in writing obtained by you from HealthCheque shall create any warranty on behalf of HealthCheque in this regard.
<h3><a name="limitation"></a>16. Limitation</h3>
You agree that, to the extent permitted by applicable law, your sole and exclusive remedy for any problems or dissatisfaction with the HealthCheque Service, the Third Party Applications or the Third Party Application content is to uninstall any HealthCheque software and to stop using the HealthCheque Service, the Third Party Applications or the Third Party Application content.
TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL HEALTHCHEQUE, ITS OFFICERS, SHAREHOLDERS, EMPLOYEES, AGENTS, DIRECTORS, SUBSIDIARIES, AFFILIATES, SUCCESSORS, ASSIGNS, SUPPLIERS OR LICENSORS BE LIABLE FOR (i) ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, PUNITIVE, EXEMPLARY OR CONSEQUENTIAL (INCLUDING LOSS OF USE, DATA, BUSINESS, OR PROFITS) DAMAGES, ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE HEALTHCHEQUE SERVICE, THIRD PARTY APPLICATIONS OR THIRD PARTY APPLICATION CONTENT, REGARDLESS OF LEGAL THEORY, WITHOUT REGARD TO WHETHER HEALTHCHEQUE HAS BEEN WARNED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF THOSE DAMAGES, AND EVEN IF A REMEDY FAILS OF ITS ESSENTIAL PURPOSE; (ii) AGGREGATE LIABILITY FOR ALL CLAIMS RELATING TO THE HEALTHCHEQUE SERVICE, THIRD PARTY APPLICATIONS OR THIRD PARTY APPLICATION CONTENT MORE THAN THE AMOUNTS PAID BY YOU TO HEALTHCHEQUE DURING THE PRIOR THREE MONTHS IN QUESTION.
HealthCheque is not liable for fraud, fraudulent misrepresentation, death or personal injury caused by the HealthCheque Service or by content, information or services provided by any affiliated or unaffiliated third party.
<h3><a name="agreement"></a>17. Entire agreement</h3>
These Agreements constitute all the terms and conditions agreed upon between you and HealthCheque and supersede any prior agreements in relation to the subject matter of these Agreements, whether written or oral. Any additional or different terms or conditions in relation to the subject matter of the Agreements in any written or oral communication from you to HealthCheque are void. You represent that you have not accepted the Agreements in reliance on any oral or written representations made by HealthCheque that are not contained in the Agreements.
Please note, however, that other aspects of your use of the HealthCheque Service may be governed by additional agreements. That could include, for example, access to the HealthCheque Community for customer support, access to the HealthCheque Service as a result of a gift card, or free or discounted Trials. You may be asked to agree to separate terms and conditions in those circumstances. Those terms and conditions shall govern only with regard to the aspect of the Service to which they apply, and are distinct from and supplemental to these Agreements, and do not supersede these Agreements. To the extent that there is any conflict between those agreements and these Agreements, these Agreements shall control, except as otherwise provided in these Terms.
Occasionally we may offer you the chance to participate in sweepstakes, contests, and surveys ("Special Promotions") through the Service. Special Promotions may be governed by terms and conditions that are separate from these Terms. If the provisions of a Special Promotion's terms and conditions conflict with these Terms, those separate terms and conditions shall prevail.
<h3><a name="severability"></a>18. Severability</h3>
Should any provision of the Terms be held invalid or unenforceable for any reason or to any extent, such invalidity or enforceability shall not in any manner affect or render invalid or unenforceable the remaining provisions of the Terms, and the application of that provision shall be enforced to the extent permitted by law.
<h3><a name="law-venue"></a>19. Choice of law, mandatory arbitration and venue</h3>
Unless otherwise required by a mandatory law of a member state of the European Union or any other jurisdiction, these Agreements are subject to the law of the State of California, United States, without regard to choice or conflicts of law principles. Further, you and HealthCheque agree to the exclusive jurisdiction of the state and federal courts in San Francisco County, California or New York, New York to resolve any dispute, claim or controversy that arises in connection with these Agreements.
If you are a United States user, the following mandatory arbitration provisions also apply to you:
<ol>
	<li>You and HealthCheque agree that any dispute, claim or controversy arising out of or relating in any way to the HealthCheque Service or your use thereof, including our Agreements, shall be determined by mandatory binding arbitration. You agree that the U.S. Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this provision, and that you and HealthCheque are each waiving the right to a trial by jury and the right to participate in a class or multi-party action. This arbitration provision shall survive termination of these Agreements and the termination of your HealthCheque account. The arbitration will be governed by the Commercial Arbitration Rules and the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes of the American Arbitration Association (the "AAA Rules"), as modified by these Agreements, and as administered by the AAA. You and HealthCheque agree that these Agreements involve interstate commerce and are subject to the Federal Arbitration Act.</li>
	<li>You and HealthCheque agree that (a) any claims seeking to enforce, protect, or determine the validity or ownership of any intellectual property rights, and (b) any claims related to allegations of theft, piracy or unauthorized use of the HealthCheque Service are NOT subject to mandatory arbitration. Instead, you and HealthCheque agree that these claims (including but not limited to claims for injunctive or equitable relief) shall be exclusively decided by courts of competent jurisdiction in San Francisco County, California or New York, New York, and that applicable California and/or Federal law shall govern, without regard to choice of law principles.</li>
	<li>YOU AND HEALTHCHEQUE AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A CLASS MEMBER OR IN ANY REPRESENTATIVE CAPACITY OR PROCEEDING. Further, no arbitrator shall consolidate any other person's claims with your claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a multi-party or class proceeding. If this specific provision is found to be unenforceable in any way, then the entirety of this arbitration section shall be null and void. The arbitrator may not award declaratory or injunctive relief.</li>
	<li>Any arbitration must be commenced by filing a demand for arbitration with the AAA within ONE (1) YEAR after the date the party asserting the claim first knows or reasonably should know of the act, omission or default giving rise to the claim; and there shall be no right to any remedy for any claim not asserted within that time period. If applicable law prohibits a one-year limitations period for asserting claims, any claim must be asserted within the shortest time period permitted by applicable law. Your arbitration fees and your share of arbitrator compensation will be limited to those fees set forth in the AAA's Consumer Rules with the remainder paid by HealthCheque. Any arbitration costs or fees deemed "excessive" will be paid by HealthCheque.</li>
